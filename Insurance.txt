##
Q56. How much insurance coverage should I have on my home?

A. The insurance coverage amount is your choice. We recommend that you purchase coverage equal to or greater than the estimated replacement cost of your home. Your home's estimated replacement cost also determines which policy options are available to you.

Since it's impossible to predict the cost to replace your home in the future, it's important to have enough coverage to account for unforeseen circumstances.

##
Q57. What is the difference between market value and replacement cost?

A. Market value is the amount a buyer would pay for the home and land in its current condition. It is influenced by factors such as proximity to good schools, local crime statistics, and the availability of similar homes.

Replacement cost is the cost to replace the entire home. When you insure your home for its estimated replacement value, your insurer will reimburse you for the cost of rebuilding your home, subject to policy limitations, based on the size and structure of the home that was lost.
Replacement cost is not:
	The market value of the home
	The home's purchase price
	The cost of the land
	The outstanding amount of any mortgage

##
Q95. What is the difference between a fixed rate mortgage and an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM)?

A. Fixed rate mortgages and ARMs are mortgage loan options.
With a fixed rate mortgage the interest rate and monthly payments for principal and interest do not change over the term of the loan.
An ARM's interest rate may change periodically based on a specified index. ARM loans may allow you to have a lower payment for a certain period of time because the interest rate is usually lower than a fixed rate mortgage. However, they carry a degree of uncertainty since rates may go up in the future.
The right type of mortgage for you depends on many factors, including:
	Your current financial state
	How long you intend to keep the house
	Your expected financial changes
	Your comfort with risk and potential mortgage payment changes

##

Non-conforming loans, or jumbo mortgages, exceed these limits.

##
Q99. What are discount points and how are they calculated?

A. Discount points are a one-time charge or credit by the lender. Each point is equal to one percent of the principal loan amount and can be paid to buy down the loan's interest rate. Points are typically paid at loan closing. If you have questions, please call us at 877-SF4-BANK (877-734-2265).

The payment due date on your mortgage note cannot be changed.

##
Q107. Can I make additional principal payments?

A. Unless stated in your mortgage documents, you can make extra principal payments of any amount with your regularly monthly payment.
To make an extra principal payment, fill out the Payment Distribution box on your mortgage billing statement coupon and indicate the dollar amount that should be applied to the principal balance. Additional principal payments will reduce the amount of principal that you owe. There will be no changes to the due date or monthly payment.

##
Q108. Will my mortgage payments change?

A. It's possible if you have an adjustable rate mortgage or an escrow account associated with your loan.
The principal and interest of a fixed rate loan does not change. The principal and interest on adjustable rate mortgages may change as outlined in your mortgage. If the principal and interest portion of your payment changes, you will receive a letter with your new payment amount.
Your monthly payment might change if you have an escrow account for the payment of real estate taxes, mortgage insurance premiums, and any other mortgage loan items. Monthly escrow payments must be one-twelfth of your annual escrow amount. If there's any change to your escrow payment, you will receive an Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement.

##
Q110. What is private mortgage insurance (PMI) and when do I need it?

A. PMI is insurance provided by non-government companies that protects mortgage lenders in the event of default by the borrower. Typically, PMI is required if your loan amount is more than 80% of the value of your property.
At the time of your loan closing the mortgage note holder will determine the PMI cancellation conditions. The mortgage note holder will consider factors including loan-to-value ratio and the property's appraised value. PMI will also provide for automatic termination for loans that are current at the earlier of the midpoint of the amortization period or the date the principal balance of your loan is first scheduled to reach 78% of the original value of your property. The borrower also has the right to request PMI be canceled on or after the date the balance on your loan is first scheduled to reach 80% of the original value of the property. Factors such as whether the loan is current and the time since the loan closed may also impact the termination of PMI.

##
Q111. What is title insurance and why do I need it?

A. Title insurance protects the lender and the homeowner against loss resulting from disputes over ownership of the property.

##
Q112. Is flood insurance required for my property?

A. Federal law requires that we perform a flood search on your property before the loan closing and that we monitor flood map changes for the life of the loan.
If your building or structure is located in a Special Flood Hazard Area, Zone A or V, as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), we require a flood insurance policy, except when exempt per federal regulation. Non-residential detached structures may not require flood insurance. We must maintain an escrow account for paying flood insurance premiums if flood insurance is required.

##
Q113. What is the minimum insurance coverage and the maximum insurance deductible allowed?

A. For homeowners insurance, the minimum coverage amount required is the lesser of the loan balance (as long as that equals 80% of the insurable value of the improvements) or 100% of the insurable value as determined by your insurance carrier. The maximum deductible for homeowners insurance is 5% of the face amount of the policy.
If you are required to have flood insurance, the minimum coverage amount required is the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the loan, the insurable value as determined by your insurance carrier, or the maximum coverage available from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) based on property type. The deductibles are governed by Federal law, but currently the maximum deductible is $10,000 for a single family dwelling and $25,000 for a condominium association policy. Please contact your agent to determine the coverage to meet your needs.

##
Q114. What is the process for getting assistance with my homeowner's claim check?

A. If your home has been damaged and you've filed an insurance claim, you can get assistance with the process and instructions on disbursing your funds. The process may vary depending on the loss. Please call the Loss Draft Hotline at 877-909-0427 for further information. Callers who are hearing or speech impaired should dial 711 or use a preferred Telecommunications Relay Service.

##
Q115. How is interest calculated on my auto loan?

A. State Farm Bank® vehicle loans are simple interest loans. Simple interest calculations are used for installment loans:
	The remaining principal is multiplied by the interest rate to calculate the total interest for one year.
	The annual interest is divided by the number of the days in the year to calculate the interest per day.
	The interest per day is multiplied by the number of days between payments to calculate the amount due each payment.
Example:

	A $20,000 loan at 8.49% APR = $1698.00 (annual interest)
	$1698.00 / 365 = $4.652 (daily interest)
	$4.652 x 30 = $139.56 (monthly interest)
	However, the first month the loan is due, $4.652 is multiplied by the number of days from the date the funds are disbursed to the date the payment is due.

##
Q116. Who holds my title?

A. This varies by state. In some states, the lienholder holds the title so State Farm Bank® would hold the title to your vehicle. Some states are title-holding states and you hold the title to your vehicle with a State Farm Bank lien on it. A few states have an electronic title that the state retains electronically.

If State Farm Bank holds the title or has a lien on the title, it will be released to you on the 10th business day after the payoff is received, processed, and all other conditions are satisfied. Please allow for normal U.S. mail time.

Note: If you live in a state that retains titles electronically, time frames may vary.
