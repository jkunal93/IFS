# IFS

Strong Intelligent FAQ Search is a search mechanism that gives smarter and better result than regular keyword search. It
uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to search more efficiently through the FAQs. The main idea behind this
project is to implement a search mechanism which gives user more desired output by recognizing what users
actually want. It uses various strategies like n-grams, synonyms, word count, noun-phrases, etc. to find a better
and more suitable solution.
