##
Q18. What constitutes a full-time student?

A. Graduate students are considered full-time if they are enrolled in at least 9 credit hours for the fall or spring semesters and for at least 4 hours during the summer.

##
Q19. Are there minimum and maximum enrollment requirements per semester?

A. During the fall and spring semesters, a graduate student must be enrolled for at least 3 hours. Minimum enrollment for summer is 1 hour (unless the summer term is being used to satisfy continuous enrollment requirements for doctoral students, in which case 3 hours are required). Maximum enrollment for fall and spring semesters is 15 hours each. In the summer semester, a student may enroll for no more than 6 hours each summer term.
If a student is on an assistantship, additional enrollment requirements apply. For .25 time employment, a student must take at least 9 hours during a fall or spring semester but no more than 15 hours. In the case of a .50 time appointment, no less than 9 hours and no more than 12 hours may be taken.

##

##
Q21. Are there continuous enrollment or time limit requirements for doctoral students?

A. Yes. Once a doctoral student successfully completes his/her comprehensive exams and enters into candidacy, he/she must maintain continuous enrollment (i.e., must register for at least 3 hours for two of the three registration periods – fall, spring and summer – during an academic year). Students who fail to meet this requirement will have to pay a penalty fee. Contact the Graduate School for details on the penalty.
Doctoral students should complete their comprehensive examination and enter the candidacy stage within four years of initial enrollment in the doctoral program and must complete their dissertation within five years of entering candidacy. The Graduate School may grant a one-year extension to this time limit for serious, nonacademic hardships. Additionally, a student may petition his or her academic program for a limited extension for a reason unrelated to personal hardship. If granted, additional requirements may be imposed upon the student; this may include passing another comprehensive examination.

##
Q22. What is meant by candidacy and continuous enrollment? 

A. A doctoral student enters into candidacy upon completion of all portions of his/her comprehensive examination. Once a student enters into candidacy he/she must maintain continuous enrollment. To be continuously enrolled, a student must register for at least 3 hours during at least two of the three semesters each academic year (i.e., fall, spring, summer).

##
Q23. If my enrollment has lapsed for one or more semesters, what do I do to enroll again?

A. If you have skipped only one regular semester (fall or spring), you must submit a Re-Admission Form, which is located on the Forms Library page.
If your enrollment has lapsed more than one regular semester, you must reapply to the graduate program. You may do this online. Indicate that you have previously been admitted to the UM Graduate School, and this enables us to obtain your UM transcript without any other action on your part.

##
Q24. Is there a penalty for breaking the continuous enrollment policy for doctoral students?

A. A financial penalty maybe be applied, depending on the circumstances that lead to the breaking of continuous enrollment. Contact the Graduate School for more information.

Details about our policies related to the administration of graduate assistantships can be found in the Graduate Program Coordinators Handbook, which is available on the Graduate School’s Web page under Forms and Manuals.

##

A. Graduate assistants who receive a 0.5 time assistantship appointment (determined as an assistantship of $800 or more per month) for a fall or spring semester and who register for 9 hours or more of graduate courses are also given a full tuition scholarship, including a nonresident fee scholarship. Graduate assistants who receive a 0.25 time appointment (determined as an assistantship of $400-$799 per month) for a fall or spring semester and who register for 9 or more hours of graduate courses are also given a 75 percent tuition scholarship and a full nonresident fee scholarship.

##
Q35. What are the refund policies regarding tuition?

A. These are complicated, and you should contact the Graduate School for explanations. A key rule is that if a tuition scholarship requires a student to be enrolled as full-time, then the action of dropping below full-time will trigger a payback of the tuition scholarship.

##

A. A financial penalty may be applied, depending on the circumstances that lead to the breaking of continuous enrollment. Contact the Graduate School for more information.
